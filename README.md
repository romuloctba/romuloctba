## Hi, I am *Rômulo Zoch* 🖐️😎👍

I am passionate developer, and I really like to build cool stuff and learn new tech.

My _github_ is not the most updated, and some of the best repos I own are private because they were used for jobs, but I really hope you can find some usefull code in here.

### Some Hobbies:

👨‍🏫 I like to teach and lecture, and really like to help other devs

✍️ I have a blog on https://rcdevlabs.github.io where I published some cool material, and I aim to get back to this 2022.

🎨 I also like to draw, 3d model, and 3d print

🎸 I do play a little guitar and bass guitar too, but don't have a band :(

*But over the years I worked in lots of other cool projects, as freelancer for many clients.*


> I am often looking for opportunities to put in practice some skills and new tech that I find interest on.
