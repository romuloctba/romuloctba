## Hi, I am *Rômulo Zoch* 🖐️😎👍

I am passionate developer, and I really like to build cool stuff and learn new tech.

My _github_ is not the most updated, and some of the best repos I own are private because they were used for jobs, but I really hope you can find some usefull code in here.

🎸 I do play a little guitar and bass guitar too, but don't have a band :(

### My carreer so far:

I have been part of some great teams working for some major players, on different industries worldwide, like:

- For the Payment/Financial domain, I worked fullstack on fraud prevention dashboards using Angular and cloudfoundry microsservices with springboot.
- For a 🦄 Retail company as fullstack developer for integrations, API and frontend, mostly with NestJs and React
- In the Health domain I was a front end developer for telemedicine of the largest diagnosis company of Latin America
- even in the clothing industry: I worked as a developer for a 3D shoes creation project, that was lots of fun



*Note*: In the above projects, I was working fulltime for the companies or outsourced.



*But over the years I worked in lots of other cool projects, as freelancer for many clients.*



> As mentioned, *I REALLY LIKE TO BUILD COOL STUFF*, so I am often looking for opportunities to put in practice some skills and new tech that I find interest on.

> I built, or helped build, Blogs, Websites, E-commerce, Omni Apps, Interactive Maps and run tracking, IoT integration, Virtual Reality Analytics, Augmented Reality, and even a Blockchain...
