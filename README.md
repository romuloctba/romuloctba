## Hi, I am *Rômulo Zoch* 🖐️😎👍

I am passionate developer, and I really like to build cool stuff.

My :github: is not the most updated, and some of the best repos I own are private because they were used for jobs, but I really hope you can find some usefull code in here.

### About Me
I have been part of some great teams and for some major players, on different industries, like:
- For the payment/financial domain, I worked frontend developer on fraud prevention dashboard using Angular.
- For a 🦄 retail/marketplaces company as fullstack developer for integrations, API and frontend
- in the health domain, I was a front end developer for the telemedicine arm of the largest diagnosis company of Latin America
- even in the clothing industry I worked as a developer for a 3D shoes customizer project, that was lots of fun


Over the years I worked in projects from different domains and scopes, like, but not only:
- Websites, E-commerce, Realtime, interactive maps and street-run tracking, IoT Web integration, Virtual Reality analytics, Augmented Reality, and even a Blockchain.


As mentioned, *I REALLY LIKE TO BUILD COOL STUFF*, so I am often looking for opportunities to put in practice some skills and tech that I find interest on.

I have a blog on https://rcdevlabs.github.io where I published some cool material, and I aim to get back to this 2022.
